## Project Description
This project is a simple “virtual laboratory” that tests and gathers results for the 
user using mathematical formulas. This project will demonstrate the concepts of free fall, projectile 
motion, static friction force, and buoyancy. A user will be able to interact with the program through 
menus, which will have error handling and looping.
